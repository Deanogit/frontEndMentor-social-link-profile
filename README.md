This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://front-end-mentor-social-link-profil.vercel.app/]

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS] (https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Typescript] (https://typescriptlang.org)

### What I learned

This is my first Front End Mentor challenge built in Next.js with TailwindCSS and TypeScript

- I mocked a fetch request by storing the social media links in a json file.
- I wrote a function to grab all the data from the json file and iterated over the data to dynamically render the social media links whilst using TypeScript to ensure type safety.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice this pattern of grabbing data and iterating over the data to dynamically render content.

- [Learn TypeScript](https://www.learntypescript.online) - I have been working through this course to get some understanding of how TypeScript works
